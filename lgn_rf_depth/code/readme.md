run visual coverage script to produce a histogram of zimuth and elevation angles covered by receptive fileds recorded for your specific set of experiment

you need to change data directory in the main function
by default it is the "sample_data/" folder

In this code you can change some parameters for debugging if you need to visualize RFs or print more info
you can also play around with hyper parameters like thresholding and histogram binning .... please check Docstrings from functions used in the script to get more insight on your options
